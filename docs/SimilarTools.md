[p4pktgen](https://github.com/p4pktgen/p4pktgen) is closely related to p4-traffictool. But the target usecases for the two tools are completely different. p4pktgen is a tool that is focused more towards testing all possible packet header combinations, whereas p4-traffictool is a tool which provides auto-generated code which the user can plug into popular traffic generation and parsing tools.

[P4 Wireshark Dissector](https://github.com/gnikol/P4-Wireshark-Dissector) also generates a Wireshark (Tshark) Lua dissector plugin for a given P4 program. However, a custom P4-defined layer can only be the last layer in the protocol stack. As a result, it supports a single custom layer in the protocol stack at a time. For example, suppose "foo" and "bar" are custom layers. Then using P4 Wireshark Dissector, you would be able to parse a packet of format `Ethernet/IP/UDP/foo` or `Ethernet/IP/bar`, but not of the format `Ethernet/IP/UDP/foo/bar` or `Ethernet/foo/bar`.
